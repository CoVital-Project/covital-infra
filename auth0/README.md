# Auth0 configs for covital

Status: These configs work in isolation but I wasn't able to import them just yet and so they were holding up the terraform plan / apply cycle in the main folder.

TODO: Get these fixed and working smoothly then promote them back up to the root folder of this repo and import/push the relevant TF state so that other devs can manage these resources as needed.
